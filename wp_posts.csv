"8","1","2007-08-31 11:43:02","2007-08-31 15:43:02","Well, lately I've been having a little fun with my laptop that I got not long ago. It's served me well, and has allowed me to work from it very nicely. The video card in it is ATI, and if you know me, you know I <strong>HATE</strong> ATI. Let me just give you a general idea of how much I hate them now after having this laptop.

If I wanted to run Beryl or Compiz from Linux... I might as well forget it. Between issues with my video card drivers and their lack of OpenGL support and the pure slowness of this video card, it's nearly impossible. I had a bit of a hack going once using XGL and Beryl, but then I couldn't use two monitors (LCD &amp; External). So it was either a single monitor and sweet effects, or two monitors and no effects. <strong>*sigh*</strong> I also had Compiz working through Xgl, but wow... it was so slow I felt like I was back on a Windows 3.1 machine waiting for notepad to open.

Now lets jump into Windows... works great, until of course I actually want to play any kind of a game. Take for example, Call of Duty. Let me just list off the requirements by the game first...
<ul>
	<li>3D video card with 32MB of RAM
OK, great, this one has 128MB of onboard (not shared) memory, no problem, right?</li>
	<li>700MHz processor
Right... 2.4GHz ok? I'd hope so.</li>
	<li>128MB of RAM
1GB in this system, good to go.</li>
</ul>
So, everything major looks good to go, install the game, start it up... LAG. It starts up at 800x600 by default, and the game is already so choppy, I want to give up. Instead, I got online and found a couple tweaks so it was at least bearable to play... still laggy though. Apparently in Windows they didn't complete OpenGL support for this video card in their drivers either. Now I've run into another problem... trying to play my Nascar Season 2003 game... for some <strong>*weird*</strong> reason it runs \"fast\". Very hard to explain, but the timer counts anywhere from 1.5-3 seconds every second. When playing the game, it's like playing in fast forward... wtf?! I can't find anyone with the same issue, I can't seem to do anything to solve it. I give up.

I'm offically signing off this laptop for any use beyond travel and other neccisary use. ATI, you <strong>*suck*</strong>. You can't just make a video card, then fail to support it. The whole rundown with the linux drivers is, ATI doesn't support the full capability of the video card, so OpenGL is useless. The open source drivers don't know how to support it, so they're just as useless. In Windows, well, I can only guess how that could possibly work. Anyway, I guess my reccomendation to you would be, if you're looking for any kind of a video card (laptop or PC) ... check out nVidia. Save yourself tons of headaches, driver wise and especially performance wise... BLARGH!","ATI ...

Yesterday was September 7th, and for those of you who don't know, that's the day that I asked Kelsey to be my girlfriend three years ago! It really has been the best time of my life because she is everything to me!! I'm so lucky to have her, I really do feel like the luckiest guy ever!

Yesterday and the night before we went to Champaign just to celebrate, it was great. The first night we went out to eat at Applebees. The food was okay, but not horrible. We just had a great time talking and eating. Then we went to the movies and saw the new Halloween movie. That movie is awesome! I jumped a few times, haha. Next we went out and went shopping for a bit, before finishing our night up with a visit to I-Hop. Last night, we went to the mall and did some shopping. I found a couple of great t-shirts that I wanted, and we got a new light that looks like a beer mug that's constantly pouring. We then went and ate at this resturaunt we've never been at before. It's called Texas Roadhouse. The food and service was spectacular. I ordered the full slab of ribs, and they are probably the best tasting ribs I've ever had.

Overall it was a great weekend. I'm so happy that we could cellebrate our three years together! I love you Kelsey, with all my heart and soul. You mean the world to me!

We got to see a couple shows on stage, and did a lot of shopping at the flea markets and garage sales. I managed to pick up a steering wheel for my computer. It's a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-Nascar-Pro-Digital-Serial/dp/B00004SYNA\">Thrustmaster NASCAR Pro Digital</a> racing wheel. I'm excited since I found it for $5 at a garage sale. I also found a Playstation (yes, the first one) with a couple controllers, memory cards, and games for pretty cheap too.

Overall it was a great weekend. I only wish I had more time here at home to do a few things here, but I still had a lot of fun. Sunday the girlfriend and I went to a waterless waterfall... figure that one out. :) I've been down there before, but this time there was just no water since it hasn't rained in a while.

"11","1","2007-09-17 09:47:59","2007-09-17 13:47:59","As some of you know, I've been working on a rewrite of SimpleIRC. SimpleIRC is a framework of sorts for IRC client connections. The core of it is finished and can be used, but I'm also working on a bot for it that will replace the current code used for my bot on <a href=\"irc://irc.freenode.net\">irc.freenode.net</a>, miniE. I also plan on extending work to include actual clients that include curses, gtk, qt3 and qt4.

Right now I've had some success in getting the bot to connect and respond to commands. All I need to get done at this point is to finalize command handling and access levels, then I can continue to develop any modules needed. I'll probably bring the new code online as miniE once I get some of the neccisary commands that some of the channels he is in require. One module that I will complete before bringing the new code online is the factoids module. I will change some of the factoids functionality by enabling commands to be called throught he factoids module if no factoid exists under the specified text. This will enable people to start \"talking to\" the bot.

I'm also looking for reccomendations of new modules to add to miniE. I'm alread planning on supporting the current list (join #php-oop on freenode and use the command `help to see all commands) and a few new ones already planned. One of them is a bartender module, another will be a current weather lookup by area code. So if any of you have any suggestions, just leave them here or e-mail me and I'll take it into consideration!","SimpleIRC Progress","0",,"publish","open","open",,"simpleirc-progress",,,"2007-09-17 09:47:59","2007-09-17 13:47:59",,"0","http://erics.seksibody.com/archives/11","0","post",,"0"
"12","1","2007-09-28 14:28:53","2007-09-28 18:28:53","SimpleIRC works! I've gotten the bot connecting to IRC and responding to commands. I've rewritten how the commands are handled and where they are stored. Previously, all commands, help text, usage, and access levels were stored in the module itself. I've made this to be more user friendly now by moving all of that to the database. I still need to do a little work on commands, but they are working! With all of that working, I can now start developing all the features of the bot. In case some of you missed it, or I forgot something, I'll list all planned modules and features.

The bot will contain core features of account management (register, login, set access level, change password), channel management (join, part) as well as commands to show basic statistics about the bot, commands, and the system it's running on. The stats will also extend to include an API for modules. This will enable each module to add a stats method that can be called by a specified command to the stats command.

Another module I'm adding to the bot is a Google search module. I will be rewriting this from the previous version which uses SOAP to use the new AJAX interface. The reason behind this is that Google is no longer releasing API keys required for SOAP. I'm not sure what effect this will have on the search module, but I'm hoping none.

I've also planned on adding a factoids module that will work similar to the one in the previous version. The new addition to this new version is that when using the bots nickname to trigger a factoid, it will also translate to perform commands if no factoid exists for that trigger. That means that saying \"miniE: help\" will trigger the help command if no factoid for \"help\" exists.

Those are the major changes I have planned so far. The following are other modules planned on being included.
<ul>
	<li>Bartender - This is a fun module that will serve up mixed drinks, shots, or just beer on command.</li>
	<li>Eval - A module to enable code evaluation. So far only PHP is planned to be supported, but I'd like to extend on that later.</li>
	<li>Lart - Want to hurt someone? Lash out at them with larts!</li>
	<li>Function Reference - Lookup a funcref for PHP4, PHP5, HTML, CSS1, CSS2, DOM1 and DOM2. Future plans to support other languages as well.</li>
	<li>Weather Lookup - Find the current temperature for your area!</li>
	<li>Temperature Conversion - Convert from F to C, C to F, F to K, C to K, K to F, or K to C</li>
	<li>Spell Check - Triggered by command or by adding (sp?) after a word to verify the spelling.</li>
	<li>Karma - Adds karma to users accounts. If no account is found for the user, karma is kept for the unknown user.</li>
	<li>Seen - Keep track of when the last time someone was on the channel and when they left.</li>
	<li>Validator - Validate your HTML and CSS documents right through IRC</li>
</ul>
That concludes the current list I have. If anyone else has any ideas for new modules or reccomendations of items to add to my current list, please let me know! I'm always open to any contribution.

"13","1","2007-10-11 07:05:53","2007-10-11 13:05:53","So, a couple of days ago I got an e-mail from Zend about Zend Studio Neon and their free beta release. I decided sometime yesterday to give it a try. I realize that the new editor is basically a version of Eclipse with PDT installed. I also noticed some other changes such as the Welcome screen is customized for Zend. Nothing special here, but I got past that and into the editor itself.

Now, first let me explain how I use Zend Development Studio right now. Currently I use it for work and a couple of my own projects that all use a SVN backend. I don't have to check them out in ZDE to get SVN working with them, it automatically detects the .svn folders within my project and lets me use SVN functionality. I'm also able to start a new project and easily create it from a folder or group of folders that I select, as well as assign external dependancies to be included while editing. I use the function completion and method completion with classes because I have a horrible memory and cannot remember arguments for some functions I only use every now and then. Beyond that, I don't expect much from ZDE besides the occasional use of the debugger, which has helped me out a few times.

Now, opening Zend Studio Neon, I realize that the editor is still beta, and that it's completely new from ZDE as it's Eclipse with PDT. I remember trying PDT not long ago and wasn't very impressed at all. It seemed to lack a lot of the basic features that ZDE has. OK, so first thing I want, I want to use my existing files and still have SVN access. I have a lot of local changes right now that I don't feel like commiting to break the whole project, so I don't want to check it out fresh again. I start a new PHP Project, type in my project name and change the default directory to where my project currently exists. It creates the project files and opens the project. First thing I check is SVN, it's there and working right off the bat. The PHP Explorer shows my revision numbers and allows me to right click and access the \"Team\" menu just as Eclipse does. Great, now I know that SVN works fine by default.

Now, lets see how editing files goes... I open up my first file and start typing away. First thing I notice is that it's pointing out a couple of errors to me already. I was using a loop and not using all my variables in the loop, which means in my assignment, I forgot to include the array keys. That could have been bad... good catch! Also, while fixing this problem, I notice that variable completion works, which is no supprise, it also worked in PDT when I tested it. Now, I open another file and find it's got a few errors in it as well. Some things are notifying me of unused variables in methods for my XML parser, others are telling me of issues where I misspelled a variable and it thinks it's undefined. Great, fix the ones that can be fixed and move on.

Now I wanted to test the function/method completion. This is one thing about PDT I wasn't completely satisfied with, but it appears to work well in Zend Studio Neon Beta. I created a new method in a parent class, then in the child class that extends it I implemented the functionality. When I start typing $this-&gt; it then pops up a window with all my methods in the class, including the ones in the parent and the one I just created. For those methods that have phpdoc comments, it also fills in the types for the arguments and return value. I write my method out and save, everything looks good and I'm deffinately enjoying this better than just Eclipse and PDT. Now, one thing I didn't mention earlier which I noticed while making changes and saving files.. in my PHP Explorer where it shows my SVN versions, on the files I've modified, there is now a &gt; infront of them signifying that they're changed. I prefer the old style where the color changed, but I can deal with this too, and it might be customizable.

So far my experiance with Zend Studio Neon Beta has been pretty plesant. When I first installed it I had a couple of issues that were a bit confusing. I blame windows though, because after rebooting and opening it up again, everything seems to work as expected. Also, one other feature I didn't get to is the phpdoc strings. It works about the same as it did in ZDE wheren when you type /** and hit enter before a method, it inserts the doc tags as expected. I can say that I like it so far, especially the fact that they're using Eclipse. I've been a fan of Eclipse for a few months now because of how easy it is to install plugins. I've been using eclipse for Python and C within the past few montsh, and now I can use Zend Neon for PHP. I also checked the Help menu where you can access the Software Updates to install new plugins. This means that I can most likely add PyDev and CDT for my Python and C needs, great! For now it looks like I'm back down to one error instead of three.

I'll post more later if I find some other interesting features of Zend Neon or if I find any problems.","Product Review: Zend Studio Neon Beta","0",,"publish","open","open",,"product-review-zend-studio-neon-beta",,,"2007-10-11 07:05:53","2007-10-11 13:05:53",,"0","http://erics.seksibody.com/archives/13","0","post",,"0"
"14","1","2007-11-01 11:17:06","2007-11-01 17:17:06","Today I was trying to get Gentoo installed on my desktop from a stage1. I wanted the ccache feature enabled, but kept getting errors like the compiler couldn't create executables and such. I went and did a little digging in the <a href=\"http://forums.gentoo.org\">Gentoo forums</a> but ended up finding nothing. It then dawned on me what was wrong after retrying without ccache.

When you first emerge ccache, it automatically creates symlinks to itself for your CHOST setting. That means that in /usr/lib/ccache/bin I had i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc symlinks to ccache. That's why compiles were failing, the compiler didn't exist on my system, but ccache was trying to use it like it did. The simple solution was to run:
<code>ccache-config --remove-links i686-pc-linux-gnu</code>
After using this, things were compiling again using ccache. I do want to note that after sys-devel/gcc emerges during bootstrapping, you'll loose ccache because it will now use the new i686-pc-linux-gnu-gcc compiler instead of ccache. All I did to fix this was pause my bootstrap using Ctrl+Z, then type the command
<code>ccache-config --install-links i686-pc-linux-gnu</code>
and then typed in %1 to resume the boostrap job I just paused. I can't prove that this made it use ccache again, but it eased my mind.

So, to sum it up, if you want ccache when compiling from a stage one, you <strong>must</strong> use
<code>ccache-config --remove-links i686-pc-linux-gnu</code>
first, then
<code>ccache-config --install-links i686-pc-linux-gnu</code>
after sys-devel/gcc has emerged to make sure ccache works with your new compiler. Hope that helps someone out there!","Gentoo stage1 install & ccache","0",,"publish","open","open",,"gentoo-stage1-install-ccache",,,"2007-12-20 10:54:42","2007-12-20 16:54:42",,"0","http://erics.seksibody.com/archives/14","0","post",,"1"

I've got Vista installed on my laptop just to give it a test drive. I'm enjoying it so far, but there's one <strong>HUGE</strong> setback that's really bugging me. I can't reach certian google sites, like <a href=\"http://mail.google.com\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"http://images.google.com\">Google Image Search</a>, just to name a couple. I'm not saying it's only google, I've noticed the issue with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com\">CNN.com</a> as well. It just seems very bizzare to me.

I've got a small network setup here at home with 4 computers. One is my server/router. It handles all requests in and out. I then have two desktop computers, one is mine and the other is my girlfriends. Both run Windows XP and I run Gentoo linux. Neither of us have any difficulty getting to any of the web sites mentioned. Now, on the laptop, I run Vista (used to run XP). When it ran XP, I could reach all of the google sites just fine, and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com\">CNN.com</a> worked great as well as <a href=\"http://mail.google.com\">Gmail</a> and <a href=\"http://images.google.com\">Google Image Search</a>. Now that I have Vista installed, I have random missing images on <a href=\"http://images.google.com\">Google Image Search</a>, and for <a href=\"http://mail.google.com\">Gmail</a>, well, I can see the login screen (barely), but not my mailbox. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com\">CNN.com</a> just completely hangs when I try to visit it.

I'm absolutely dumbfounded by this behavior. I've had Vista also on both desktops with the <strong>SAME</strong> issue. It's not just an incompatable NIC because I've tried several NICs through my process of trouble shooting. I've also tried differnet settings and configurations on my router. If anyone has any ideas, or possibly some way I could trace the connection problem down, please let me know!! I'm at my absolute witts end with this. I'm just looking for a way to even find where the connection is stopping... hopefully I can get this solved because I'm sure others out there are having similar issues too.

Edit - 12-11-2008: After doing some extensive testing on this, it really seems to be just an issue of drivers. With newer hardware and drivers, everything has been running fine Vista installs.","Vista and Google ... network problems?","0",,"publish","open","open",,"vista-and-google-network-problems",,,"2008-12-11 10:39:37","2008-12-11 15:39:37",,"0","http://erics.seksibody.com/archives/15","0","post",,"4"

I've been getting a lot of work done on it during my spare time (which isn't much). I've fixed quite a few bugs in the main Core module and the Client code. I've also added some functionality pretty much everywhere, including some new modules. I still don't know when I'll have an offical release ready, but it's looking promising that it will be soon!

First major change I've made is moving all of the modules off the MySQLdb module and into using <a href=\"http://www.sqlalchemy.org/\">SQLAlchemy</a>, which offers a vast variety of methods to interact with the database, as well as support for multiple database backends. The main feature I like about it is the fact that it enables you to create an object for each table and row in the database. It makes dealing with things a lot easier. I also redesigned the database to better support changes made and to add better functionality.

So far, I've got the following modules completely built and working;
<ul>
	<li>Eval</li>
	<li>Factoids</li>
	<li>Lart</li>
	<li>Seen</li>
	<li>Weather</li>
</ul>
The Core module is build, but not all the features are there yet. I'm also still working on how the handler methods work for commands, because I'd like to find a way to allow command access levels to be changed on the fly using the database, but still be specified if there is no record in the database. I'm also planning on adding functionality for users to enter their e-mail address for validation and password retreval purposes. I still have to work on the other modules annouced, but it's coming along very nicely so far.

I still have some bugs left to squash, and plenty of functionality in the client itself to implement, so if anyone would like to help as a tester or developer, please let me know.

"17","1","2007-11-18 14:59:00","2007-11-18 20:59:00","So recently I've been playing with wxWidgets and Python. I've enjoyed it so far, but I've found one problem that I haven't really found a good solution for. When creating a window in Windows, the default background seems to be a rather dark gray. My theme for Windows is the windows classic, which shows all windows as a light grey color. The menu bar and the status bar of the application are the light grey desired, but the background of the application itself and any text label widgets I create are all dark gray. It makes no sense to me.

The solution I've found so far is to set the main window background to the color of the menubar background. This seems to make everything conform to the default light gray. Here's the code from my custom wx.Frame class:
<code style=\"overflow: auto;\">
self.SetBackgroundColour(wx.SystemSettings.GetColour(wx.SYS_COLOUR_MENUBAR))
self.SetBackgroundStyle(wx.BG_STYLE_COLOUR)
</code>
This sets the frame's background to the correct expected color. I'm not sure if this is the way I should be going about things since I'm new to wxWidgets, so if anyone has any suggestions for me, please let me know! I'll post an update later this week when I get further along with my client. Right now I've taken a break from the SimpleIRC bot part of things and am creating a GUI interface for a client.

Instead of the normal PHP or Python adventures, I've been working with a game language for <a href=\"http://www.callofduty.com\">Call of Duty</a>. It's structured somewhat like C++ but there's quite a few differences. I won't get into them now, but perhaps at a later date I'll post my findings on the language itself, somewhat of a tutorial of sorts. Anyway, I've been working with this language to create my own mod for the game.

Why do I want to do this, you may ask? It's for a few reasons, but mainly because I'm curious and picky. I can't find a mod out there that does everything I like. Out of the mods I can find, I can't find one that works without modification and is easy to add on to. I'm modeling my code closely after another mod that I've downloaded and like, but I'm rebuilding the code, hopefully fixing a few flaws and problems I've seen and ran into with the other mod. I'm also taking things from another mod I like that will add features that aren't in the mod I'm modeling mine after.

I haven't got much done so far, but I'm hoping sometime this week I'll have some actual code that can be tested on my server. I'm going to have quite a few features in it, like the ability to maintain a crouch only server (this means that there is no standing and running, you must remain crouched), user punishment methods, bash only (weapon melee only attack), weapon damage modifiers, weather effects, and lots of other things. I'll make another post explaining more, it's pretty interesting stuff though.

When I was using <a href=\"http://php.net/set_include_path\">set_include_path()</a> and <a href=\"http://php.net/ini_set\">ini_set()</a> to set the include_path, both functions would return false. It took me some time and a bit of help from <a href=\"http://www.pixelated-dreams.com\">Davey</a> to finally figure out what was going on.

In my Apache configuration I was using php_admin_value to set an include_path for one of my virtual hosts. If you're not familiar with php_admin_value, you can see the manual page <a href=\"http://php.net/configuration.changes\">here</a>. By using php_admin_value in the httpd.conf (or a vhost), you're there by telling PHP to force that setting and disallow anything else to change it, meaning PHP scripts or even .htaccess files. That was fine, except what I didn't realize, is that for some reason PHP sees that setting and disallows it to be changed in any other virtual host or PHP script running under Apache. I can only speculate that this behavior is a bug and not intended. I would assume for that value to only affect the virtual host it was declared in, but instead, I spent 30 minutes debugging my code wondering why my calls to set_include_path() were returning false.

Let me just clarify for a second, the virtual host I had php_admin_value on was called, lets say foo.example.com and the code I was working on, that was returning false, was in the virtual host for bar.example.com. So, as soon as I realized that was the only place I was using php_admin_value at was foo.example.com, I changed it to php_value and restarted Apache with the new configuration. Instantly the code on bar.example.com began working as expected and setting my new include_path value. I'm not sure if this is default expected behavior, but it's not what I expected at all. I will be filing a bug report to verify this though.

Well, that was my fun for the evening. I just wanted everyone to be aware of the effects php_admin_value and php_admin_flag have on your Apache configuration.

I'm currently reading a new book, working on <a href=\"http://www.php-oop.net\">php-oop.net</a> and working full time. This week I've also come down with a bad cold. Yesterday before getting off work I started to feel pretty crappy, so I went and layed down after work. Wound up falling asleep around 7 last night and didn't make it back out of bed until 8:30 this morning. So far it's just a head cold, but my whole body aches and I've got a slight fever. Nothing I can't deal with though.. start popping the cold pills and I'll be ok. Right now I just feel groggy because my whole head is clogged up.

On the programming side of things, I have been working on <a href=\"http://www.php-oop.net\">php-oop.net</a>. Not much has been done recently, except I got my friend <a href=\"http://blog.matthewharris.org\">kuja</a> to help me out with a new design. I don't have it active on the <a href=\"http://dev.php-oop.net\">dev site</a> yet, but I plan on doing so as soon as we iorn out a few things with the design. Just take note that the dev site might not always work as it's updated from SVN and could break. However, it's given me new motivation to actually want to work on the backend of the site now. Currently, there's only some basic user stuff implemented, which leaves a lot to be desired. At least it shows a base system that's somewhat functional. The SiTech backend that runs the site also needs work too, so I'm sort of maintaining both projects at once.

As far as progress with SimpleIRC, I haven't really touched it in a couple weeks. I've kept myself busy with other things. I really need to get back to SimpleIRC though as everyday miniE is showing more and more issues that I don't want to take the time to fix since I am writing a new bot. Things with my new server are going smoothly. I've since setup a lot of new stuff like SSL, virtual e-mail addresses, and a Call of Duty game server. I admit, I don't have a lot of time to play Call of Duty, but that's my own fault. It's at least nice to have a server up and running.

<legend>Introduction</legend>
Welcome to my <strong>\"What you should know about <em>X</em>\"</strong> series. Over the next few weeks/months, I will be writing more tutorials on things that I've learned through my experiences with PHP on a daily basis that I think everyone else should know. This series will be a series of tutorials showing good and bad ways of doing whatever the subject is, and explaining why each is good and each is bad. I will also include tutorials that will show how to do some basic and advanced things.

This week we're discussing a very important issue called <strong>\"<em>Dynamic Includes</em>\"</strong> that I've come across a lot by using PHP and helping other users that use PHP to build their professional and personal websites. There's a lot of bad tutorials out there that can mislead an inexperienced programmer to thinking that user input is safe and does not need to be checked. This, of course, is <strong>WRONG</strong>. User input should never be trusted and should always be vigorously checked no matter the situation. Not just because it can be malicious, but because people make mistakes. I might cover this in another article, but it is something to take into consideration when using dynamic includes that are based upon user input. Lets move on.
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>The Bad and The Ugly ... The Good is taking a break.</legend>
First lets look at includes. I'm assuming you all know the basics of an include statement and the difference between a static include and a dynamic include. Just in case though, a static include is where a variable that cannot be changed is used in an include or require.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include('page.php');
?&gt;</pre>
A dynamic include is an include based upon input from a variable. The following code uses a dynamic include based on a variable's value.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
$var = 'page.php';
include($var);
?&gt;</pre>
Now, this include statement isn't all that dangerous since we define the variable right before the include, but what if it's another situation where the variable is defined in another page or a section of the script where the variable might change before it gets to the include? This is where value checking becomes necessary. Now lets move on and take a look at our first example.

The most common use of dynamic includes is when you setup a home page where your links show up like http://example.com/?page=about.php or http://example.com/index.php?page=about.php. The most common way (and one of the <strong style=\"color: red\">worst</strong> ways of doing this, is by the code below...
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include($_GET['page']);
?&gt;</pre>
Now, you may argue that this works. It in fact will work, however it's very insecure! What if someone wanting to do something malicious and say find all the users on your box? Well, if it's Linux, all they would have to do is call http://example.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd and it would show them the file. This of course can happen for any file on your system that apache can read. Most of the time the /etc/passwd file is in fact not world readable, so this wouldn't be possible, but why risk it? Now lets go on to look at another situation.

Now that you've seen that, you're probably thinking of other ways to try to make the script more secure. Some of you might ask \"Why not put the path in front of the include to force the path?\" Well, lets take a look and see! Again, we're using the same URL example where http://example.com/?page=about.php or http://example.com/index.php?page=about.php
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include('/home/user/www/'.$_GET['page']);
?&gt;</pre>
OK, so we've appended the path to the include... safer right? <strong style=\"color: red\">WRONG</strong>! While this looks safer than before because we've appended the path, it's actually just as insecure. We still have no input checking and malicious input can still be entered. This might detour some in experienced person, but others would know to put in a page that would never be found, for example http://example.com/index.php?page=hahayoucantfindmeever.php Which would then cause include to show this warning
<code>
Warning: include(/home/user/www/hahayoucantfindmeever.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/user/www/index.php on line 2
</code>
<strong>*Gasp*</strong> now you can see by the warning \"include(/home/user/www/hahayoucantfindmeever.php)\" that the path is \"/home/user/www/\" because for our input, we only used \"hahayoucantfindmeever.php\". Now all the person has to do is use http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd and they have your /etc/passwd file again! So, as you can see, this is just as insecure as before. Now lets take a look at something a bit more secure.
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>The Ugly... very ugly.</legend>
As I've said all along, user input needs to be checked against and should never be trusted! In our first two examples, our include was based upon user input and as we found, was very insecure. Now I'll show you how to take that user input and validate it before using it in the include. We're still not going to be doing it the best way, but I'm hoping by showing you as many examples as possible, it will give you some kind of idea of how to validate input first. Our URLs will now change to look something like http://example.com/?page=about and http://example.com/index.php?page=about OK, lets take an array of pages and check against that, here's the code...
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
/* this is our array of pages we can use */
$pages = array('home', 'about', 'contact');

/* Now lets test our user input */
if (!isset($_GET['page']) || !isset($pages[$_GET['page']])) {
    include('/home/user/www/'.$pages[0].'.php'); /* Grab the default page */
} else {
    include('/home/user/www/'.$_GET['page'].'.php');
}
?&gt;</pre>
This is much better than our previous examples because now we're actually checking the input against something in our code now. While this will work and is a lot more secure, it should still never be trusted as we're still using the user input in our include statement! While it would be much harder to bypass this, why risk it? Why leave the script open to possible attack on our include? We shouldn't! Lets take a look at other examples on how we can secure this further.
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>The Good ... hooray, our hero has arrived!</legend>
The previous array example can be expanded upon to make it a bit more secure, but since we would still be using the user input in the include statement, I won't go into that. Lets take a look at a method that checks the user input, but in no way uses it in our include statement, thus removing user input from being used in a place where it shouldn't. This example will use a simple switch statement to include each page based on the user input. Our example URL will still be http://example.com/?page=about or http://example.com/index.php?page=about
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
switch ($_GET['page'])
{
    case 'about':
        include('/home/user/www/about.php');
        break;

    case 'contact':
        include('/home/user/www/contact.php');
        break;

    default:
        include('/home/user/www/home.php');
        break;
}
?&gt;</pre>
There! Now we've removed the user input from our include statements, thus disallowing the user from getting something he isn't supposed to! This can also be done using a if/elseif/else statement, but I prefer using switch. There are also other ways of keeping user input out of dynamic includes, but I feel this is the easiest way, and can be used in many situations. Since I've already shown a basic page, lets look at something more advanced. Say you want 404 error reporting if the page isn't found, it's not too hard to add in, lets look.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
$page = (isset($_GET['page']))? $_GET['page'] : '';

switch ($page)
{
    case 'about':
        include('/home/user/www/about.php');
        break;

    case 'contact':
        include('/home/user/www/contact.php');
        break;

    case 'home':
    case '':
        include('/home/user/www/home.php');
        break;

    default:
        include('/home/user/www/404.php');
        break;
}
?&gt;</pre>
Now you've got a page that displays your home page when no other page is defined, and a 404 page when the page defined isn't found! We've also removed a possible notice that could have been shown by checking if $_GET['page'] was set first by using the <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php\">ternary operator</a>. All in all, this is a pretty decent example of how dynamic includes can be made safer so the user isn't allowed to use malicious attacks against the page.
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>Conclusion</legend>
Well, we've looked at a lot of methods using include statements, The Good, The Bad, and there was plenty of The Ugly. I hope you learned something from this article, especially that you should always validate your input! Next article I think I'll go a bit more in depth on validating input in general. There are many ways it can be done, and you should be aware of all of them! So, until next time!

I'm really just posting to let everyone know that I might not be online a whole lot of the next few days. As some of you know, I live in an apartment above my girlfriend's parent's house. Well, last night around 3:30am there was a fire in the basement... everyone got out okay, but the house is devistated. It only burnt the basment and a little of the room above the basement, but everything in the house itself was destroyed by smoke. My apartment just got a little smoke in it, but everything is ok up there. I feel so bad for my g/f's family because they basically lost everything.

Right now I'm staying in a hotel for a couple nights until I can get power hooked back up to the apartment. From there I've got to get in and get all of my stuff packed up, and then find a new place to live. The g/f's family has already got a couple things lined up for them as they're getting a lot of help, which is good. I don't know how long it will take to get power back, or even if I will be able to. So my connectivity will be very on/off for the next few days at least. I'll keep everyone updated as to what's going on... I just ask for prayers and thoughts as we go through this challenging time.

I have to say, they've done a pretty decent job with it. The feature set is very robust and integration with the Zend debugger is very nice. It uses PDT plus some extras to provide excellent PHP IDE support. It's got all the good stuff of Zend Studio and Eclipse combined in one. Out of the problems I noticed in the beta's, most have been fixed, but there's still a few lingering.

One issue is mainly an issue with Eclipse itself, there's no way to convert spaces to tabs or vice-versa. There's also no way to make it trim spaces on the end of lines. This is a feature that Zend Studio has had itself in previous versions. An easy fix to this is a plugin made by <a TARGET=\"_new\" HREF=\"http://andrei.gmxhome.de/\">Andrei Loskutov</a> called <a TARGET=\"_new\" HREF=\"http://andrei.gmxhome.de/anyedit/\">AnyEdit</a>. It's made for Eclipse itself, but since Zend Studio Neon is Eclipse, it installs easily using the directions provided on the page.

Another issue, which was really the show stopper for me, is that the building of the workspace will sometimes \"freeze\". I say \"freeze\" because Neon continues to respond, however, you can no longer save any files, close the workspace, or close Neon itself. I must note that I only experianced this issue twice within the few weeks that I used it. It's annoying enough of an issue that I don't care to deal with it. Both times I had the problem was when I went to save a file and it wouldn't save, therefore loosing the work I had just completed. I have noticed that sometimes it does take a while for the project to build the workspace, but I gave it plenty of time to continue each time and it did not make any progress.

Other than those two problems, Zend Studio Neon is a very solid PHP IDE. I haven't gotten around to testing every little feature, but I enjoyed working with it and would reccomend it with caution.

I could join games and play all I wanted, however, when my girlfriend wanted to play too, it would disconnect both of us from the games. I searched and tried different things, also upgraded the firmware, all to no avail. I finally solved the issue by setting up a port trigger for the port the game uses.

I had tried before to setup a port trigger, but kept getting errors about the ports being the same. I don't know what I did different the last time I tried it, but it seems to have worked. I just set the application name to \"CoD\" and set all four port fields to 28690, which is the default port for Call of Duty.

This should work for CoD, CoD2, and possibly CoD4 (but I'm unsure since I haven't looked at the ports for it.) I checked the \"Enable\" checkbox and then clicked the \"Save Settings\" button. Once the router saved the settings and redirected me back to the page, I was then able to join a game, and have my girlfriends computer do the same.","Linksys WRT54G Router and Call of Duty","0",,"publish","open","open",,"linksys-wrt54g-router-and-call-of-duty",,,"2008-04-04 12:45:52","2008-04-04 17:45:52",,"0","http://blog.php-oop.net/?p=31","0","post",,"0"

I've been on the phone with them several times due to constant disconnects, slow speeds, and other miscellanious problems. Aparently the story I've gotten from them is that their lines are too full, and the traffic is causing lots of slowdowns. Recently though, I've found that this might not at all be the case. After doing some reasearch a few days ago due to noticing my lag spike constantly, I have found some very compelling evidence that my ISP is doing some traffic capping.

I was searching around and actually found <a href=\"http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19492512-Other-Charter-sold-local-franchise-to-Avenue-Broadband\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> nice big post about Avenue. Now, within that post I have found the following post about their TOS <a href=\"http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19766570-Re-Other-Charter-sold-local-franchise-to-Avenue-Broadband\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r19766570-Re-Other-Charter-sold-local-franchise-to-Avenue-Broadband</a>. This post seems to describe what is a bandwidth cap that they put on their customers. While this isn't compelling enough to prove that they put a cap on people, I also found this post <a href=\"http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r20175452-\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r20175452-</a>. Now, this seems to show that they ARE capping users. How dumb is this?

I never really noticed a cap until recently. Over the past week or more, I have been getting very slow speeds for my downloads. At first I thought it was something else, but then I noticed it more and more, then happened to come across these posts, and finally everything added up! I've been capped! I pay around $70 for 10Mbit internet access... this seems really pricey if I'm going to get a cap put on me after 3GB of downloads. I almost go through this in a few days due to working from home. After getting all this information and now realizing what's going on, I'm outraged. I can't belive I'm paying so much for so little! I have plans to call them and confront them, so I'll post again about how that goes. I'm also looking into other internet service providers, as I can't have this type of service when I work from home. I also refuse to pay more money just so I can get more transfers, just to be capped again.

So, in conclusion, I just wanted to put it out there for anyone in the service area of Avenue Broadband. I think everyone should be aware of this, even though they're trying to hide it.  It really pisses me off to see this happening and them not being very open about it. I think it's very pricey for the amount I'm paying to have this cap.. anyway, I'll post again when I get done talking with them.

UPDATE - 6-18-2008<br />
Well, after a couple weeks, I've spoken to them, I've had a technition out here, and I'm still very upset. I can't confirm or deny a cap on the internet speed. I called and spoke with two people who said my account was capped, however, both refered me to the local office because that's where they do the capping at. So, once I called up there and spoke with them, they told me that they do not put caps on accounts anymore. Since that day I haven't seemed to be under a cap, however I'm not getting my 10Mbit service. As I mentioned, I had a tech come out and check things out. He found a few problems with my line going to my cable modem and ran a whole new line for it. Since that, I have only been disconnected once, which was Monday (the 16th), and I was out for a good 6+ hours. So, I'm still very unhappy with my service, and I plan on getting DSL as soon as my credit card activates.","AvenueBroadband Cable","0",,"publish","open","open",,"avenuebroadband-cable",,,"2008-06-18 09:10:52","2008-06-18 14:10:52",,"0","http://blog.php-oop.net/?p=35","0","post",,"0"

<legend>Introduction</legend>
Welcome to my <strong>\"What you should know about <em>X</em>\"</strong> series. Over the next few weeks/months, I will be writing more tutorials on things that I've learned through my experiences with PHP on a daily basis that I think everyone else should know. This series will be a series of tutorials showing good and bad ways of doing whatever the subject is, and explaining why each is good and each is bad. I will also include tutorials that will show how to do some basic and advanced things.

This week we're discussing a very important issue called <strong>\"<em>Dynamic Includes</em>\"</strong> that I've come across a lot by using PHP and helping other users that use PHP to build their professional and personal websites. There's a lot of bad tutorials out there that can mislead an inexperienced programmer to thinking that user input is safe and does not need to be checked. This, of course, is <strong>WRONG</strong>. User input should never be trusted and should always be vigorously checked no matter the situation. Not just because it can be malicious, but because people make mistakes. I might cover this in another article, but it is something to take into consideration when using dynamic includes that are based upon user input. Lets move on.
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>The Bad and The Ugly ... The Good is taking a break.</legend>
First lets look at includes. I'm assuming you all know the basics of an include statement and the difference between a static include and a dynamic include. Just in case though, a static include is where a variable that cannot be changed is used in an include or require.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include('page.php');
?&gt;</pre>
A dynamic include is an include based upon input from a variable. The following code uses a dynamic include based on a variable's value.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
$var = 'page.php';
include($var);
?&gt;</pre>
Now, this include statement isn't all that dangerous since we define the variable right before the include, but what if it's another situation where the variable is defined in another page or a section of the script where the variable might change before it gets to the include? This is where value checking becomes necessary. Now lets move on and take a look at our first example.

The most common use of dynamic includes is when you setup a home page where your links show up like http://example.com/?page=about.php or http://example.com/index.php?page=about.php. The most common way (and one of the <strong style=\"color: red\">worst</strong> ways of doing this, is by the code below...
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include($_GET['page']);
?&gt;</pre>
Now, you may argue that this works. It in fact will work, however it's very insecure! What if someone wanting to do something malicious and say find all the users on your box? Well, if it's Linux, all they would have to do is call http://example.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd and it would show them the file. This of course can happen for any file on your system that apache can read. Most of the time the /etc/passwd file is in fact not world readable, so this wouldn't be possible, but why risk it? Now lets go on to look at another situation.

Now that you've seen that, you're probably thinking of other ways to try to make the script more secure. Some of you might ask \"Why not put the path in front of the include to force the path?\" Well, lets take a look and see! Again, we're using the same URL example where http://example.com/?page=about.php or http://example.com/index.php?page=about.php
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include('/home/user/www/'.$_GET['page']);
?&gt;</pre>
OK, so we've appended the path to the include... safer right? <strong style=\"color: red\">WRONG</strong>! While this looks safer than before because we've appended the path, it's actually just as insecure. We still have no input checking and malicious input can still be entered. This might detour some in experienced person, but others would know to put in a page that would never be found, for example http://example.com/index.php?page=hahayoucantfindmeever.php Which would then cause include to show this warning
<code>
Warning: include(/home/user/www/hahayoucantfindmeever.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/user/www/index.php on line 2
</code>
<strong>*Gasp*</strong> now you can see by the warning \"include(/home/user/www/hahayoucantfindmeever.php)\" that the path is \"/home/user/www/\" because for our input, we only used \"hahayoucantfindmeever.php\". Now all the person has to do is use http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd and they have your /etc/passwd file again! So, as you can see, this is just as insecure as before. Now lets take a look at something a bit more secure.
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>The Ugly... very ugly.</legend>
As I've said all along, user input needs to be checked against and should never be trusted! In our first two examples, our include was based upon user input and as we found, was very insecure. Now I'll show you how to take that user input and validate it before using it in the include. We're still not going to be doing it the best way, but I'm hoping by showing you as many examples as possible, it will give you some kind of idea of how to validate input first. Our URLs will now change to look something like http://example.com/?page=about and http://example.com/index.php?page=about OK, lets take an array of pages and check against that, here's the code...
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
/* this is our array of pages we can use */
$pages = array('home', 'about', 'contact');

/* Now lets test our user input */
if (!isset($_GET['page']) || !isset($pages[$_GET['page']])) {
    include('/home/user/www/'.$pages[0].'.php'); /* Grab the default page */
} else {
    include('/home/user/www/'.$_GET['page'].'.php');
}
?&gt;</pre>
This is much better than our previous examples because now we're actually checking the input against something in our code now. While this will work and is a lot more secure, it should still never be trusted as we're still using the user input in our include statement! While it would be much harder to bypass this, why risk it? Why leave the script open to possible attack on our include? We shouldn't! Lets take a look at other examples on how we can secure this further.
</fieldset>
<fieldset>
<legend>The Good ... hooray, our hero has arrived!</legend>
The previous array example can be expanded upon to make it a bit more secure, but since we would still be using the user input in the include statement, I won't go into that. Lets take a look at a method that checks the user input, but in no way uses it in our include statement, thus removing user input from being used in a place where it shouldn't. This example will use a simple switch statement to include each page based on the user input. Our example URL will still be http://example.com/?page=about or http://example.com/index.php?page=about
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
switch ($_GET['page'])
{
    case 'about':
        include('/home/user/www/about.php');
        break;

    case 'contact':
        include('/home/user/www/contact.php');
        break;

    default:
        include('/home/user/www/home.php');
        break;
}
?&gt;</pre>
There! Now we've removed the user input from our include statements, thus disallowing the user from getting something he isn't supposed to! This can also be done using a if/elseif/else statement, but I prefer using switch. There are also other ways of keeping user input out of dynamic includes, but I feel this is the easiest way, and can be used in many situations. Since I've already shown a basic page, lets look at something more advanced. Say you want 404 error reporting if the page isn't found, it's not too hard to add in, lets look.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
$page = (isset($_GET['page']))? $_GET['page'] : '';

switch ($page)
{
    case 'about':
        include('/home/user/www/about.php');
        break;

    case 'contact':
        include('/home/user/www/contact.php');
        break;

    case 'home':
    case '':
        include('/home/user/www/home.php');
        break;

    default:
        include('/home/user/www/404.php');
        break;
}
?&gt;</pre>
Now you've got a page that displays your home page when no other page is defined, and a 404 page when the page defined isn't found! We've also removed a possible notice that could have been shown by checking if $_GET['page'] was set first by using the <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php\">ternary operator</a>. All in all, this is a pretty decent example of how dynamic includes can be made safer so the user isn't allowed to use malicious attacks against the page.
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Well, we've looked at a lot of methods using include statements, The Good, The Bad, and there was plenty of The Ugly. I hope you learned something from this article, especially that you should always validate your input! Next article I think I'll go a bit more in depth on validating input in general. There are many ways it can be done, and you should be aware of all of them! So, until next time!

I've still got Windows so I can dual boot, but there's just times when it isn't practical to dual boot... so I've come up with another solution. I've installed VMWare Player and created a virtual machine to install Windows XP onto.

Once I got VMWare Player installed, I ran into a few issues. My first issue was that it was unable to find a specific symbol... this was in relation to recompiling dev-cpp/gtkmm with the use flag \"accessibility\". Once that is rebuilt you also need to rebuild x11-libs/libsexy, dev-cpp/libsexymm and x11-libs/libview. Once those are rebuilt, the error about the missing symbol went away, then it was on to a whole new error message.

Now I've finally gotten everything back and setup on a virtual machine, thanks to my friend <a title=\"admo.net\" href=\"http://admo.net\" target=\"_blank\">Adam</a>. Even though I was a wee bit (heh) behind on payments, he was still a good enough friend to hook me up with something that works for both of us. So now I can post all of my ramblings again that you probably won't even read. :P

Nothing real exciting has gone on lately... I've caught a cold, that's really it. I guess on another side note, I have been working on somewhat of a new exciting project. It's a custom gallery I've built for myself. As it is currently it doesn't really do much, but I have been working on the admin side of things to get everything going the way I think it should. Right now it adheres to a current directory layout parsing images and spitting out thumbnails. While I was developing, I figured... hey, why not do movies too? So I did... it also makes thumbnails for all kinds of movie files. I even added embeded HTML to allow for playing the videos, though I prefer the FLV method.

I'm not really sure when I'll have a good preview available... I just kinda work on it when I'm bored. Anyway, I don't have much to say besides that, so I'll let you all get on with not reading this.

Now I've finally gotten everything back and setup on a virtual machine, thanks to my friend <a title=\"admo.net\" href=\"http://admo.net\" target=\"_blank\">Adam</a>. Even though I was a wee bit (heh) behind on payments, he was still a good enough friend to hook me up with something that works for both of us. So now I can post all of my ramblings again that you probably won't even read. :P

Nothing real exciting has gone on lately... I've caught a cold, that's really it. I guess on another side note, I have been working on somewhat of a new exciting project. It's a custom gallery I've built for myself. As it is currently it doesn't really do much, but I have been working on the admin side of things to get everything going the way I think it should. Right now it adheres to a current directory layout parsing images and spitting out thumbnails. While I was developing, I figured... hey, why not do movies too? So I did... it also makes thumbnails for all kinds of movie files. I even added embeded HTML to allow for playing the videos, though I prefer the FLV method.

I'm not really sure when I'll have a good preview available... I just kinda work on it when I'm bored. Anyway, I don't have much to say besides that, so I'll let you all get on with not reading this. Will post again soon, I hope.","I'm baackkk!!","0",,"inherit","open","open",,"44-revision",,,"2008-10-31 01:16:40","2008-10-31 06:16:40",,"44","http://blog.php-oop.net/archives/45","0","revision",,"0"

I've got Vista installed on my laptop just to give it a test drive. I'm enjoying it so far, but there's one <strong>HUGE</strong> setback that's really bugging me. I can't reach certian google sites, like <a href=\"http://mail.google.com\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"http://images.google.com\">Google Image Search</a>, just to name a couple. I'm not saying it's only google, I've noticed the issue with <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com\">CNN.com</a> as well. It just seems very bizzare to me.

I've got a small network setup here at home with 4 computers. One is my server/router. It handles all requests in and out. I then have two desktop computers, one is mine and the other is my girlfriends. Both run Windows XP and I run Gentoo linux. Neither of us have any difficulty getting to any of the web sites mentioned. Now, on the laptop, I run Vista (used to run XP).

I'm absolutely dumbfounded by this behavior. I've had Vista also on both desktops with the <strong>SAME</strong> issue. It's not just an incompatable NIC because I've tried several NICs through my process of trouble shooting. I've also tried differnet settings and configurations on my router. If anyone has any ideas, or possibly some way I could trace the connection problem down, please let me know!! I'm at my absolute witts end with this. I'm just looking for a way to even find where the connection is stopping... hopefully I can get this solved because I'm sure others out there are having similar issues too.

I am running amd64, so the first problem I had with totem is that it wouldn't create thumbnails or play certian video files due to missing codecs. Some of codecs I was missing was MPEG-4 and some of the WMV codecs. If you've ever used the x86 branch, you know that by enabling win32codecs, you can get all of the neccisary codecs installed. Of course, this doesn't work in the amd64 branch, but after a bit of googling, I tried installing gstreamer-plugins-ffmpeg. Once I got that installed, thumbnails started showing up and videos started playing just fine. If you don't really like totem, I can't say I blame you, there's also VLC which with the proper use flags works fine as well for watching videos.

Another issue I came across was when I was browsing around some files and realized that Nautalis wasn't displaying thumbnails for .flv files. I remember coming across this a long time ago and never finding a solution for the problem, but today things have changed. One thing you will need is gstreamer-plugins-ffmpeg installed. From what I understand <a href=\"http://bugs.archlinux.org/task/10802\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, thumbnails don't show up due to Totem not getting the right mime type for FLV files. The comments mention that this is fixed in Totem 2.23.4, but amd64 only has 2.22.2. You've probably already noticed the XML file on the link, but I couldn't make it work in its current format. So, I recreated the file using a format that worked fine for me. To load the file into your configuration just run the command `gconftool-2 --load flv_thumbnailerschema.xml`.

<ul>
	<li>I've been coding for about 10 years now. I started when I was about 15 by learning HTML and Perl. Shortly after though, I picked up on PHP3 and the journey began. I used to love being an admin on the EvilWalrus website, and actually gained most of my knowledge while coding on the site. Now I enjoy languages such as PHP, Python, C/C++ and C#.</li>
	<li>I've been with my girlfriend Kelsey for over four years now. She is my everything, and I plan to spend every minute of my life with her. I want to travel the whole world with her and see everything we possibly can. She is the most amazing person and the most amazing thing to ever happen to me. I honestly can't wait to make her my wifey :)</li>
	<li>I'm actually adopted. I love my parents who adopted me very much, and I'm also so happy that they were able to give me more than I ever expected as a child. I don't know my birthmother at all and I don't have any desire to. I have a paper with her name and her mothers name on it, but there is no name or any information for my birthfather.</li>
	<li>I've been to over twenty states during my childhood while traveling with my parents. I've also been to Cancun Mexico three different times, to Hawaii four times and Pearl Harbor twice. I've been able to ski in Colorado, snowmobile in Wyoming, and watch hot air baloon show in New Mexico. The thing I remember the most from all the traveling though is in Hawaii when we went downhill mountan biking. We had to get up at 4am in the morning and take a bus ride to the top of a mountan where we watched satallites orbit above us, and then the sunrise.</li>
	<li>I don't get along with my family very well. I'm very close to my parents and grandparents, but not at all with any of my aunts, uncles or cousins. It's partially because I'm the second youngest out of 25 cousins and partially because I feel like an out cast and not accepted into my family.</li>
	<li>I was home schooled from 7th grade all the way through high school. This was for a couple of reasons, one is because of all the traveling I was doing with my parents. Another is because the kids at the private school I went to loved to pick on me and I hated it. While I enojyed home schooling, I feel like I missed out on a lot by not going to high school.</li>
	<li>I actually know how to do a lot more than use computers and program. My dad is a developer, so while growing up I learned a lot from him. I can operate several types of equipment like tractors, backhoes, loaders, bulldozers, and skid loaders. I've also had to lay sod, pour and curve concrete curbs, and do lots of odd jobs for him. My favorite thing is when he would get new land and there would be buildings that we had to tear down and destroy. I've seen some of the hottest and biggest fires from burning the debris. My dad has shown and taught me a lot of things that I'm very thankful for.</li>

	<li>I was home schooled from 7th grade all the way through high school. This was for a couple of reasons, one is because of all the traveling I was doing with my parents.

Here's my seven things:
<ul>
	<li>I've been coding for about 10 years now. I started when I was about 15 by learning HTML and Perl. Shortly after though, I picked up on PHP3 and the journey began. I used to love being an admin on the EvilWalrus website, and actually gained most of my knowledge while coding on the site. Now I enjoy languages such as PHP, Python, C/C++ and C#.</li>
	<li>I've been with my girlfriend Kelsey for over four years now. She is my everything, and I plan to spend every minute of my life with her. She is the most amazing person and the most amazing thing to ever happen to me. I honestly can't wait to make her my wifey :)</li>
	<li>I'm actually adopted. I love my parents who adopted me very much, and I'm also so happy that they were able to give me more than I ever expected as a child. I don't know my birthmother at all and I don't have any desire to. I have a paper with her name and her mothers name on it, but there is no name or any information for my birthfather.</li>
	<li>I've been to over twenty states during my childhood while traveling with my parents. I've also been to Cancun Mexico three different times, to Hawaii four times and Pearl Harbor twice. I've been able to ski in Colorado, snowmobile in Wyoming, and watch hot air baloon show in New Mexico. The thing I remember the most from all the traveling though is in Hawaii when we went downhill mountan biking. We had to get up at 4am in the morning and take a bus ride to the top of a mountan where we watched satallites orbit above us, and then the sunrise.</li>
	<li>I don't get along with my family very well. I'm very close to my parents and grandparents, but not at all with any of my aunts, uncles or cousins. It's partially because I'm the second youngest out of 25 cousins and partially because I feel like an out cast and not accepted into my family.</li>

We've been looking for houses to rent around the area and have found some decent places, I'm just hoping that there will still be good places around the time that we're wanting to move too. I can't wait to move, it'll be exciting to have a change and be somewhere different from the past four years. We've both decided though that a couple of her sisters are going to make the move with us, that way its easier for her to adjust without her whole family there, and they get to experience something new and exciting too.

I've been talking with mah hunnies about moving this summer, and I think we've finally made a decision on who what when where how. We've been talking for a while to move back to my home town St. Joseph, MO and we've finally decided to do that this summer. It will most likely be at the end of the summer, but we're looking for a house to rent. I'm really excited about it and really can't wait. I don't have an exact date yet, but we're thinking around the end of August.

We've been looking for houses to rent around the area and have found some decent places, I'm just hoping that there will still be good places around the time that we're wanting to move too. I can't wait to move, it'll be exciting to have a change and be somewhere different from the past four years.

"96","1","2009-11-30 13:34:57","2009-11-30 19:34:57","Well, I'm finally doing it. I'm rewriting my voodoo code that makes reloadable modules or plugins in PHP. I've always toyed with the idea of rewriting my original work for PHP_Modules and making it work with classes; now the time has come. I have started work with my <a title=\"Trac for SiTech\" href=\"http://trac.php-oop.net/SiTech/\" target=\"_blank\">SiTech</a> library to make SiTech_Plugins. It will be the same concept of PHP_Modules, but not only will it work with functions, it will now work with classes. This is something that was never really possible before because when PHP_Modules was written, it was written for PHP 4.

I haven't gotten very far yet with code, but the theory of it is to create a base class with a __call() method. That's basically all the base class will consist of. When a plugin is loaded, the class read from the plugin file will be created to extend this base class. From there, all methods found within the class will be stored as lambda functions inside a special class variable. This then makes it easy to reload code, by recreating the lambda function when the code is reloaded. Therefore, the class itself never needs to be redefined, it just needs all the functions reloaded. So, in theory this is entirely possible with PHP 5 and the use of the magic __call() method for classes.

Some of you may wonder why I don't use <a title=\"runkit\" href=\"http://pecl.php.net/package/runkit\" target=\"_blank\">runkit</a> from PECL. While it would make things a ton easier, I wanted more of a code solution that might work for everyone without extra requirements. I might look into creating it to work both ways though. I can imagine runkit would be a lot cleaner method of doing such voodoo, but I'm also unsure if runkit will even compile with 5.3.  I'll have to do some research into that and find out for sure. Of course, there will be more to come as I make progress even if its good or bad progress.","SiTech_Plugins","0",,"publish","open","open",,"sitech_plugins",,,"2009-11-30 13:34:57","2009-11-30 19:34:57",,"0","http://blog.php-oop.net/?p=96","0","post",,"0"

I haven't gotten very far yet with code, but the theory of it is to create a base class with a __call() method. That's basically all the base class will consist of. When a plugin is loaded, the class read from the plugin file will be created to extend this base class. From there, all methods found within the class will be stored as lambda functions inside a special class variable. This then makes it easy to reload code, by recreating the lambda function when the code is reloaded. Therefore, the class itself never needs to be redefined, it just needs all the functions reloaded. So, in theory this is entirely possible with PHP 5 and the use of the magic __call() method for classes.

Some of you may wonder why I don't use <a title=\"runkit\" href=\"http://pecl.php.net/package/runkit\" target=\"_blank\">runkit</a> from PECL. While it would make things a ton easier, I wanted more of a code solution that might work for everyone without extra requirements. I might look into creating it to work both ways though. I can imagine runkit would be a lot cleaner method of doing such voodoo, but I'm also unsure if runkit will even compile with 5.3.  I'll have to do some research into that and find out for sure.","SiTech_Plugins","0",,"inherit","open","open",,"96-revision",,,"2009-11-30 13:34:21","2009-11-30 19:34:21",,"96","http://blog.php-oop.net/archives/97","0","revision",,"0"

<h4>Introduction</h4>
Welcome to my <strong>\"What you should know about <em>X</em>\"</strong> series. Over the next few weeks/months, I will be writing more tutorials on things that I've learned through my experiences with PHP on a daily basis that I think everyone else should know. This series will be a series of tutorials showing good and bad ways of doing whatever the subject is, and explaining why each is good and each is bad. I will also include tutorials that will show how to do some basic and advanced things.

This week we're discussing a very important issue called <strong>\"<em>Dynamic Includes</em>\"</strong> that I've come across a lot by using PHP and helping other users that use PHP to build their professional and personal websites. There's a lot of bad tutorials out there that can mislead an inexperienced programmer to thinking that user input is safe and does not need to be checked. This, of course, is <strong>WRONG</strong>. User input should never be trusted and should always be vigorously checked no matter the situation. Not just because it can be malicious, but because people make mistakes. I might cover this in another article, but it is something to take into consideration when using dynamic includes that are based upon user input. Lets move on.
<h4>The Bad and The Ugly ... The Good is taking a break.</h4>
First lets look at includes. I'm assuming you all know the basics of an include statement and the difference between a static include and a dynamic include. Just in case though, a static include is where a variable that cannot be changed is used in an include or require.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include('page.php');
?&gt;</pre>
A dynamic include is an include based upon input from a variable. The following code uses a dynamic include based on a variable's value.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
$var = 'page.php';
include($var);
?&gt;</pre>
Now, this include statement isn't all that dangerous since we define the variable right before the include, but what if it's another situation where the variable is defined in another page or a section of the script where the variable might change before it gets to the include? This is where value checking becomes necessary. Now lets move on and take a look at our first example.

The most common use of dynamic includes is when you setup a home page where your links show up like http://example.com/?page=about.php or http://example.com/index.php?page=about.php. The most common way (and one of the <strong style=\"color: red\">worst</strong> ways of doing this, is by the code below...
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include($_GET['page']);
?&gt;</pre>
Now, you may argue that this works. It in fact will work, however it's very insecure! What if someone wanting to do something malicious and say find all the users on your box? Well, if it's Linux, all they would have to do is call http://example.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd and it would show them the file. This of course can happen for any file on your system that apache can read. Most of the time the /etc/passwd file is in fact not world readable, so this wouldn't be possible, but why risk it? Now lets go on to look at another situation.

Now that you've seen that, you're probably thinking of other ways to try to make the script more secure. Some of you might ask \"Why not put the path in front of the include to force the path?\" Well, lets take a look and see! Again, we're using the same URL example where http://example.com/?page=about.php or http://example.com/index.php?page=about.php
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
include('/home/user/www/'.$_GET['page']);
?&gt;</pre>
OK, so we've appended the path to the include... safer right? <strong style=\"color: red\">WRONG</strong>! While this looks safer than before because we've appended the path, it's actually just as insecure. We still have no input checking and malicious input can still be entered. This might detour some in experienced person, but others would know to put in a page that would never be found, for example http://example.com/index.php?page=hahayoucantfindmeever.php Which would then cause include to show this warning
<code>
Warning: include(/home/user/www/hahayoucantfindmeever.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home/user/www/index.php on line 2
</code>
<strong>*Gasp*</strong> now you can see by the warning \"include(/home/user/www/hahayoucantfindmeever.php)\" that the path is \"/home/user/www/\" because for our input, we only used \"hahayoucantfindmeever.php\". Now all the person has to do is use http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd and they have your /etc/passwd file again! So, as you can see, this is just as insecure as before. Now lets take a look at something a bit more secure.
<h4>The Ugly... very ugly.</h4>
As I've said all along, user input needs to be checked against and should never be trusted! In our first two examples, our include was based upon user input and as we found, was very insecure. Now I'll show you how to take that user input and validate it before using it in the include. We're still not going to be doing it the best way, but I'm hoping by showing you as many examples as possible, it will give you some kind of idea of how to validate input first. Our URLs will now change to look something like http://example.com/?page=about and http://example.com/index.php?page=about OK, lets take an array of pages and check against that, here's the code...
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
/* this is our array of pages we can use */
$pages = array('home', 'about', 'contact');

/* Now lets test our user input */
if (!isset($_GET['page']) || !isset($pages[$_GET['page']])) {
    include('/home/user/www/'.$pages[0].'.php'); /* Grab the default page */
} else {
    include('/home/user/www/'.$_GET['page'].'.php');
}
?&gt;</pre>
This is much better than our previous examples because now we're actually checking the input against something in our code now. While this will work and is a lot more secure, it should still never be trusted as we're still using the user input in our include statement! While it would be much harder to bypass this, why risk it? Why leave the script open to possible attack on our include? We shouldn't! Lets take a look at other examples on how we can secure this further.
<h4>The Good ... hooray, our hero has arrived!</h4>
The previous array example can be expanded upon to make it a bit more secure, but since we would still be using the user input in the include statement, I won't go into that. Lets take a look at a method that checks the user input, but in no way uses it in our include statement, thus removing user input from being used in a place where it shouldn't. This example will use a simple switch statement to include each page based on the user input. Our example URL will still be http://example.com/?page=about or http://example.com/index.php?page=about
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
switch ($_GET['page'])
{
    case 'about':
        include('/home/user/www/about.php');
        break;

    case 'contact':
        include('/home/user/www/contact.php');
        break;

    default:
        include('/home/user/www/home.php');
        break;
}
?&gt;</pre>
There! Now we've removed the user input from our include statements, thus disallowing the user from getting something he isn't supposed to! This can also be done using a if/elseif/else statement, but I prefer using switch. There are also other ways of keeping user input out of dynamic includes, but I feel this is the easiest way, and can be used in many situations. Since I've already shown a basic page, lets look at something more advanced. Say you want 404 error reporting if the page isn't found, it's not too hard to add in, lets look.
<pre name=\"code\" class=\"php\">
&lt;?php
$page = (isset($_GET['page']))? $_GET['page'] : '';

switch ($page)
{
    case 'about':
        include('/home/user/www/about.php');
        break;

    case 'contact':
        include('/home/user/www/contact.php');
        break;

    case 'home':
    case '':
        include('/home/user/www/home.php');
        break;

    default:
        include('/home/user/www/404.php');
        break;
}
?&gt;</pre>
Now you've got a page that displays your home page when no other page is defined, and a 404 page when the page defined isn't found! We've also removed a possible notice that could have been shown by checking if $_GET['page'] was set first by using the <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php\">ternary operator</a>. All in all, this is a pretty decent example of how dynamic includes can be made safer so the user isn't allowed to use malicious attacks against the page.
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Well, we've looked at a lot of methods using include statements, The Good, The Bad, and there was plenty of The Ugly. I hope you learned something from this article, especially that you should always validate your input! Next article I think I'll go a bit more in depth on validating input in general. There are many ways it can be done, and you should be aware of all of them! So, until next time!

Recently I purchased Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 because I'm a huge fan of the Call of Duty series. I owned the first and second Call of Duty games on the PC. Once I got my xbox 360, one of the first games I purchased was Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Of course, once I heard news of Modern Warfare 2, I had to have it! The differences between Call of Duty 4 and Modern Warfare 2 weren't substantial, but there was enough there to entice me and I enjoyed the game thoroughly. Infinity Ward had done a great job up to this point with the series. It was an incredible experience and the multiplayer was always fun to play. Then came Call of Duty: Black Ops ... this time Activision used Treyarch instead of Infinity Ward to make the game.

Being a huge fan of the series, I decided I had to have Black Ops as part of my collection. I went to the midnight release and got the game after a huge build up from Modern Warfare 2. I admit, I enjoyed the Black Ops campaign and the multiplayer at first. They introduced some cool new features like diving, tomahawks, ballistic knives, etc. The leveling system of multiplayer was a change from the Modern Warfare 2 system, so it kept things enjoy able. At first I was in love, I played the game as much as I could. As they released patches, the little things that annoyed me, started to annoy me more and more. First off, Treyarch tried to fix the spawn trapping, which they did... but it created more problems than it fixed. Now instead of spawning where you had no exit... you could potentially spawn in the middle of the enemy. Take two steps and boom, you're dead. My favorite is when I would spawn and immediately die from a grenade launcher that was obviously already in flight before I spawned. So, after playing long enough, I decided that Black Ops was not better than Modern Warfare 2 when it came to gameplay, however the advancements in other areas made it better as a whole. Still, the problems I found with the game made me quit playing it completely.

Now, just recently, Activision has come out with Modern Warfare 3. They brought back Infinity Ward to produce the game. While I haven't played very much at all yet, I have to say, I am not impressed in the least. So far Modern Warfare 3 seems like the same game as Modern Warfare 2 with different maps. Therefore it seems like a regression from Black Ops to me. The graphics are back to the Modern Warfare 2 graphics with minor improvements, they did not carry over diving from Black Ops either. The UI (User Interface) looks nearly identical to Modern Warfare 2 with some color changes. The spawning seems to be greatly improved from both Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, which is a plus for me. I really want to give this game a good chance to be fair, but I cannot stand the fact that they didn't feel the need to improve on their previous engine at all. I almost feel cheated by Activision and a series that I have loved since the beginning.

To sum it up, I'm not convinced that Modern Warfare 3 lives up to its hype at all. Its really like playing a game I've already played at the core. While there are a few new features, and lots of different maps, its nothing that I haven't already seen. I feel like I wasted $60 in hopes for something new. I still have yet to put some serious hours in to Modern Warfare 3, so I will more than likely follow up this post.. but here's to hoping I don't stay disappointed.","Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3","0",,"publish","open","open",,"black-ops-and-modern-warfare-3",,,"2011-11-10 12:21:54","2011-11-10 18:21:54",,"0","http://blog.php-oop.net/?p=133","0","post",,"2"

Infinity Ward had done a great job up to this point with the series. It was an incredible experience and the multiplayer was always fun to play. Then came Call of Duty: Black Ops ... this time Activision used Treyarch instead of Infinity Ward to make the game.

Being a huge fan of the series, I decided I had to have Black Ops as part of my collection. I went to the midnight release and got the game after a huge build up from Modern Warfare 2. I admit, I enjoyed the Black Ops campaign and the multiplayer at first. They introduced some cool new features like diving, tomahawks, ballistic knives, etc. The leveling system of multiplayer was a change from the Modern Warfare 2 system, so it kept things enjoy able. At first I was in love, I played the game as much as I could. As they released patches, the little things that annoyed me, started to annoy me more and more. First off, Treyarch tried to fix the spawn trapping, which they did... but it created more problems than it fixed. Now instead of spawning where you had no exit... you could potentially spawn in the middle of the enemy. Take two steps and boom, you're dead. My favorite is when I would spawn and immediately die from a grenade launcher that was obviously already in flight before I spawned. So, after playing long enough, I decided that Black Ops was not better than Modern Warfare 2 when it came to gameplay, however the advancements in other areas made it better as a whole. Still, the problems I found with the game made me quit playing it completely.

Now, just recently, Activision has come out with Modern Warfare 3. They brought back Infinity Ward to produce the game. While I haven't played very much at all yet, I have to say, I am not impressed in the least. So far Modern Warfare 3 seems like the same game as Modern Warfare 2 with different maps. Therefore it seems like a regression from Black Ops to me. The graphics are back to the Modern Warfare 2 graphics with minor improvements, they did not carry over diving from Black Ops either. The UI (User Interface) looks nearly identical to Modern Warfare 2 with some color changes. The spawning seems to be greatly improved from both Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, which is a plus for me. I really want to give this game a good chance to be fair, but I cannot stand the fact that they didn't feel the need to improve on their previous engine at all. I almost feel cheated by Activision and a series that I have loved since the beginning.

To sum it up, I'm not convinced that Modern Warfare 3 lives up to its hype at all. Its really like playing a game I've already played at the core. While there are a few new features, and lots of different maps, its nothing that I haven't already seen. I feel like I wasted $60 in hopes for something new. I still have yet to put some serious hours in to Modern Warfare 3, so I will more than likely follow up this post.. but here's to hoping I don't stay disappointed.","Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3","0",,"inherit","open","open",,"133-revision-2",,,"2011-11-10 11:22:06","2011-11-10 17:22:06",,"133","http://blog.php-oop.net/archives/146","0","revision",,"0"
