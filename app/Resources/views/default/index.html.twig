        <p>
            I am a self taught software engineer with over 15 years of extensive experience in primarily web
            development. Through the years I have been able to branch out some and get experience with desktop
            applications, and through my own curiousness, built back end services as well like an IRC bot. I have also
            had the opportunity to put my linux abilities to the test and become a system administrator for a small
            enterprise system.

                    Through my career I have mostly been a full stack LAMP developer. My primary focus in development has
                    been in <a href="https://php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> but I have had a few opportunities to branch
                    out and do some <a href="https://python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> development as well. I'm
                    familiar with several languages and proficient with multiple databases, primarily being
                    <a href="https://mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> and
                    <a href="https://postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I run <a href="https://archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> as my daily
                    operation system, but I have had experience with many Linux distributions. I've used most major
                    distrobutions including the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> and
                    <a href="https://centos.org/" target="_blank">CentOS</a> flavors. Though I have used and supported Windows in the
                    past, it has been a few years since I've used it as my primary operating system.

            These are a few of my personal projects that I have either worked on in the past, or am currently working
            on in my spare time. It is through these projects that I am able to explore new ideas, technologies, and
            teach myself new concepts. Though not all of them are currently active, they have all played a big role in
            my development.

            <p>
                Desk Changer is a <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell" target="_blank">Gnome Shell</a>
                extension that is written using JavaScript with <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Gjs"
                                                                   target="_blank">gjs</a>, and Python for the separate
                daemon process. Its purpose is to provide the ability to rotate the background wallpaper at a set
                interval. This extension comes with the unique ability to add multiple profiles. Each profile can
                contain any amount of folders or files that will be rotated through. It is currently available for
                download on the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1131/desk-changer/"
                                   target="_blank">Gnome Shell Extensions</a> website.

                This portfolio site is another example of my abilities. It is built using the
                <a href="https://php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> language with
                <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> as the package manager. It is built on the
                <a href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony Framework</a> with a
                <a href="https://mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database for the backend. On the front end, I'm using
                <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank">Yarn</a> for package management and
                <a href="https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore" target="_blank">Encore</a> with
                <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">WebPack</a> for JS and CSS minification. While it is
                currently a very static site, my plan is to develop it into something that can easily be used by others as
                a portfolio website. In a sense, it will be a Content Management System that is very specific to developers
                and their portfolio.

            <p>
                SiTech is a code library that I wrote for PHP several years ago and have not actively maintained in
                a couple of years. It was originally my alternative to using a full framework or the
                <a href="https://pear.net/" target="_blank">PEAR Library</a> as they were both heavy with dependencies.
                The purpose of SiTech being a library was so that you could easily use individual parts of the library,
                much like a framework, but without the dependency on any other part of the library. Since writing it I
                have started to use other code libraries and, at this point, no longer wish to maintain my own. Some day
                I might attempt to rewrite this library for PHP 7 using some of the newer features in the language and
                apply some newer patterns that I myself have learned.

            <p>
                SimpleIRC is a project I created several years ago. It was initially written to be an IRC bot, but my
                insight changed to wanting more of a library than a client. At first it was written in PHP, but after
                finding limitations when creating reloadable code modules, I rewrote the project in Python. Several
                years back I unfortunately lost the original code in a hard drive failure and did not have backups. I
                have not, since, taken the time to recreate the original work.
