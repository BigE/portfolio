        <p>
            I am a self taught software engineer with over 15 years of extensive experience in primarily web
            development. Through the years I have been able to branch out some and get experience with desktop
            applications as well. I have also, through my own curiousness, built back end services as well like
            an IRC bot.

                This portfolio site is another example of my abilities. It is built using the
                <a href="https://php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> language with
                <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> as the package manager. It is built on the
                <a href="https://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony Framework</a> with a
                <a href="https://mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database for the backend. On the front end, I'm using
                <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank">Yarn</a> for package management and
                <a href="https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore" target="_blank">Encore</a> with
                <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">WebPack</a> for JS and CSS minification. While it is
                currently a very static site, my plan is to develop it into something that can easily be used by others as
                a portfolio website. In a sense, it will be a Content Management System that is very specific to developers
                and their portfolio.

            <p>
                SimpleIRC is a project I created several years ago. It was initially written to be an IRC bot, but my
                insight changed to wanting more of a library than a client. At first it was written in PHP, but after
                finding limitations I rewrote the project in Python.
