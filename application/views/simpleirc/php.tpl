	<h3>About SimpleIRC</h3>
	<p>
		SimpleIRC is an IRC bot that started out written in PHP and was later
		converted to Python. Its purpose is to receive commands and return info
		useful to users. It also supports user registration, and user elevation
		for special commands.

	<h2>SimpleIRC - PHP</h2>
	<p>
		While the PHP version of SimpleIRC doesn't exist code wise anymore, the
		ideas and concepts used to make it, still exist. Coding it in PHP was
		very informative and helped me learn a lot. However, PHP itself was very
		limiting in what I wanted to accomplish. I found that it would prove
		more useful to build the bot in another language that actually supported
		the features I wanted in the bot. That's when the switch from PHP to
		Python started.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had written code to take PHP files and parse them up using the
		tokenizer extension. This would then load all the functions inside the
		file and using lmbada functions, create reloadable modules. This was the
		basics of the idea behind the bot, to create a program that could
		continue to run, and allow parts of it to update the code used without
		ending the program.
